# Project02_46W38
Repository for Project 2 of course 46W38. The project focuses on building and simulating 'Turbie', a forced 2DOF mass-spring-damper system based on the DTU 10 MW Reference Wind Turbine.

Summary of Results
Blade and tower displacements increase with wind speed due to higher aerodynamic loading.
Higher turbulence intensity (TI) leads to stronger oscillations and higher standard deviations of displacements.
Blade displacements are consistently larger and more sensitive than tower displacements.
The model demonstrates physically realistic dynamic response behavior of a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) turbine system.
At low wind speeds, both displacements remain small and stable, while at higher speeds, nonlinear aerodynamic effects become more pronounced.
Overall, the simulation results clearly show how wind speed and turbulence together affect the stability and vibration levels of the turbine structure.
